# KKBOX's Churn Prediction

## Problem Statement

KKBOX is a music streaming service that mainly targets the markets of Asia. They offer a large and varied music library that contains 
over 30 million tracks. Since the service is working on a freemium basis, it is very crucial for the company to keep its paying
customers from canceling or not paying their membership. 

Customer churn or customer default is a business problem that all companies have to deal with, and it is very important to have a solution
in place to reduce the churn rate and to also know the reasons behind why customers are leaving. 

The definition of churn for KKBOX's use case is as follows:
> A churning customer is a subscribed customer that does not make a new subscription transaction within 30 days after the
> current membership expiration date.
